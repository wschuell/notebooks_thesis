# Notebooks of the thesis
Docker container for re-executing the simulations and replotting the figures of the phd thesis found here:

[Active Control of Complexity Growth in Language Games](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02073770v1)

To directly replot figures without having to recompute simulations (may require several weeks or even months of CPU time on a single computer), see releases with databases of pre-computed results.

Otherwise, you can recompute or modify to compute your own results using the [experiment manager library](https://github.com/wschuell/experiment_manager), already included in the docker.
